Have you noticed how similar you are to your friends? \uline{It may be because your brains operate in harmony with each other}. We know that friends are more likely to be the same age, gender and ethnic background as each other. Now it seems their brains are alike, too.

Research ers at the University of California scanned the brains of 42 classmates while they watched videos intended to provoke varying responses. Some people might find a romantic scene touching, for instance, while others would feel it was embarrassing. The activity of friends' brains was more similar than that of people who didn't know each other, particularly in regions involved in attention, emotion and language. This similarity was strong enough that it could be used to predict whether two people were already friends or not. \uline{The relationship probably goes two ways.}We are dra wn to people who think like us; we th en in fl uence thei r thoughts over time, w hich may push their brain activity into more closely resembling our own.
