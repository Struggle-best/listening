If you are in a western country, you'll often see people
walking their dogs. It is still true that the dog is the most
useful animal in the world. However, the reason why
one keeps a dog has changed.

Once upon a time, a man met a dog and wanted it to help
him in the fight against other animals, and the dog listened
to him and did what he told him to do.

Later, people used dogs for hunting other animals,
and dogs did not eat what they got until their masters
agreed. Dogs were also used for driving sheep\sn{n. 羊} and guarding
chickens.

But now people in towns and cities do not need dogs to
fight other animals any more. Of course, they keep them
to frighten thieves\sn{n.小偷 thief的复数}. But the most important reason for keeping dogs is that they feel lonely in the city.

For a child, a dog is his best friend when he has no friends
to play with. For a young wife, a dog is her child when she
does not have her own. For old people, a dog is also a
child when their real children have grown up and left\sn{adj.
	左边的 v.离开（某人或某处）；抛弃}.

Now, people do not have to use a dog, but they
keep it as a friend just like a member of the family.

Britain has a well-respected\sn{受人尊敬的} higher education system and
some of the top universities and research institutions\sn{机构} in
the world. But to those who are new to this system, it can
sometimes be confusing.

October is usually the busiest month in the academic
calendar. Universities have something called Freshman's
Week for their newcomers. It's a great opportunity to make
new friends, join lots of clubs and settle\sn{v. 解决，结束（争端等），定居} into university
life.

However, having just left the comfort of home and all your
friends behind, the prospect\sn{n. 可能性,前景 v. 勘探} of meeting strangers in classrooms
and dormitories\sn{dormitory 复数,宿舍} can be worrying. Where do you
start? Who should you make friends with? Which clubs and
society should you join?

Luckily, there will be thousands of others in the same boat\sn{船 }
as you. They worry about starting their university social life
on the right foot. So just take it all in slowly. Don't rush into
anything that you'll regret\sn{v. 懊悔} for the next three years.


\subsection{城市套路深，我要回农村}
\begin{margintable}\vspace{-2cm}\footnotesize
	\includemedia[
	addresource=sound/fivestep/L3城市套路深·挑战原声.mp3]{\faBullhorn}{VPlayer.swf}
\end{margintable}

I am living in a small village in the country. My wife
and I run a village shop. We have a very peaceful life,
boring, some might say. But we love it. We know all the
people in the village. They have plenty\sn{富裕} of time to stop and
chat.

I have plenty of time for my hobbies too—gardening\sn{园艺，garden 花园}, fishing,
walking in the country side. I love the outdoor life.
It wasn't always like this though. I used to have a
really stressful job, working so late in the office every evening.
I often brought work home at the weekends.

The advertising world is very competitive. And when I look
back, I can't imagine how I stood it. I have no private life 
at all. No time for the really important things in life.
Because of the pressure of the job, I used to smoke and
drink too much.

The crisis came when my wife left me. She complained
that she never saw me and I had no time for family
life. This made me realize what was really important
to me. I talked things through with her and decided to get
back together again and started a new and better life together.

I gave up tobacco and alcohol and searched for new
hobbies. Now I am afraid of looking back since the past
life seemed a horrible dream.
\subsection{安道尔}
Andorra, one of the smallest countries in the world, is located
high in the mountains between France and Spain\sn{n. 西班牙}.
The country covers only 179 square miles. That is less
than half the size of New York City.

High, rocky\sn{岩石的,不稳的 rock n. 岩石} mountains surround Andorra. Until the
1930s, travelers had difficulty reaching the country. Up until
that time, people in Andorra lived the way they had lived
for centuries\sn{世纪，区别于 country 国家}. Most Andorrans worked as farmers. Things
did not change quickly.

When roads were built from France and Spain to Andorra
in the 1930s, life picked up speed. Tourists began
to visit the small country. These tourists brought in a lot of
money to spend while visiting. Many people in Andorra
found new jobs in shops or hotels. These changes helped
to keep young people in Andorra.

There were many more jobs than before the roads were
built. Today tourists provide 80 to 90 percent of Andorra's
income. More than a million\sn{n. 百万} people visit each year.

They come to view the rough\sn{adj. 粗糙的} mountains. They enjoy the
quiet\sn{adj. 轻声的 n. 安静} way of life. Most people are also interested in the ancient\sn{古代的} buildings. There are many shops for tourists to browse\sn{浏览}
in, clothes, watches, wines and other items are sold at low
prices in Andorra. Import fees\sn{费用, fee的复数} are low, so tourists enjoy the
inexpensive\sn{便宜的} shopping.

Most of the businesses in Andorra are owned by its citizens.
There are not many foreign\sn{外国的} businesses\sn{foreign businesses 外资企业}. Some Andorrans still farm and raise\sn{举起，抚养} sheep and cattle. But most
are now involved with the tourist trade\sn{贸易 treat 对待}.

\subsection{美国同学这么爱读书}
According to a survey on reading conducted\sn{进行} in 2001 by
the U.S. National Education Association\sn{协会}, young Americans
say reading is important, more important than computers
and science.

Over 50\% of the 12- to 18-year-olds interviewed said they
enjoy reading a lot. 79\% find it
stimulating\sn{adj. 使人兴奋的 v. 促进} and interesting. And 87\% think it is relaxing.
About 68\% of those surveyed disagree with the opinion
that reading is boring or old-fashioned\sn{过时的}.

Over half the teenagers interviewed said they read more
than ten books a year. The results also showed that middle
school students read more books than high schoolers. Over 66\% of teens liked to read fiction\sn{小说，虚构的事}, such as novels and
stories. Only 26\% were interested in non-fiction, such as
history books.

64 \% of students listed reading stories about
people their own age as their favorite kind of book. Mysteries
and detective\sn{n. 侦探} stories came second on the list at 53\%.
Just under 50\% said they were interested in reading about
their own culture and traditions.

Of the teenagers who participated in the survey, 49\%
said that libraries are where they get most of their books.
However, many complain that their school libraries do not
have enough up-to-date interesting books and magazines.

Even though many teenagers in the U.S. enjoy reading,
they still have other interests. When asked which activity
would be the most difficult to give up for a week, 48\%
said listening to music. TV would be difficult to give up for
25\% of those surveyed.
\subsection{达芬奇的生平}
Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 in Tuscany\sn{ 托
	斯卡纳，意大利的一个大区，首府为佛罗伦萨} . As early as
1466, he was working in a workshop\sn{车间,工厂}.

Then, in 1482, he moved to Milan. After the plague\sn{n.瘟疫 v.困扰}
had swept the city of Milan in 1484 and '85, he turned in
his attention to town planning and made several designs
for churches and other buildings.

He moved to Florence\sn{佛罗伦萨}—another city in Italy—
in 1500, where he painted the famous Mona Lisa in 1503.
Then he returned to Milan.

Between 1510 and 1515, after he had been working
as an architect\sn{n.建筑师} and engineer to the French King, Louis
XII, he devoted himself to painting again, and 
produced two great works—\ul{St. Anne, Mary and the Child}\sn{圣安妮，玛丽和孩子} and \ul{St. John the Baptist}\sn{施洗者圣约翰}.

In 1515, the king of France invited Leonardo to live in
France. He moved to a castle\sn{城堡} there where he spent his last
years carrying out his own research. He died in 1519.

\subsection{要么不做，要么做好}
My father woke me up early one morning when I was
fourteen and announced “Get up. You are going with me
to cut grass.” I felt proud and excited because my
father thought I was responsible enough to help him in his
business.

Still, that first day was very hard. From sunrise to sunset, my
father, my younger brother and I cut and trimmed very
large yards in well-to-do parts of the city. By
the end of the day I was exhausted, but I felt good. I had
put in a hard day's labor and had earned six dollars.

One day, my father spotted some weeds I had
missed cutting and pulled me inside. “Cut that section
again!” he said firmly “and don't make me have to tell you to do it again.”

The message was very clear. Today I stress the importance
of doing the job right the first time.

Every job I have held from cutting lawns to washing dishes
to working a machine on the construction site, I have
learned something that helps me in my next job. If
you work hard enough, you can learn from any job you
do.
\subsection{困在风雪中如何自救}
Good transportation is very important in winter. If you
have a car, make sure it is ready for the cold weather.
Keep the gas tank as nearly full as you can. This will keep
water out of the tank and will be a reserve in case you get
into trouble.

If a storm traps you in your car, there are some steps
you should take for your own safety. Do not attempt to
walk to find help. You may quickly lose your way in blowing
and drifting snow\sn{吹雪天气的成因是强风吹起积雪，分为高吹雪(blowing snow)、低吹雪(drifting snow)、暴风雪(blizzard/snowstorm)}. Your chances of being found are
better if you stay in your car.

Keep a downwind window open slightly for fresh air. Freezing
rain can seal off your car and lock you inside. Run the
engine and heater once in a while. Keep the same downwind
window open while the engine is running. Make sure
that snow has not blocked the exhaust pipe.

Clap your hands and move your arms and legs from time
to time. Do not stay in one position too long. But, do not
move too much. Exercise warms you up, but it also
causes you to lose body heat.

If more than one person is in the car, do not sleep at the
same time. One person should always be awake. If you
are alone, stay awake as long as you can. Turn on the inside
light at night. This would make your car more visible
to rescue crews. Don't panic. Stay with your car.
\subsection{新年前夜怎么过?}
For many people in the west, New Year's Eve is the biggest
party of the year. It's a time to get together with friends or
family and welcome in the coming year.

New Year's parties can take place in different places.
Some people hold a house party; others attend street parties,
while some just go for a few drinks with their friends.

Big cities have large and spectacular fireworks displays.
There is one thing that all New Year's Eve parties have
in common, the countdown to midnight. When the clock
strikes 12, people give a loud cheer and sing songs.

It's also popular to make a promise in the New Year. This
is called a New Year's resolution. Typical resolutions
include giving up smoking and keeping fit.

However, the promise is often broken quite quickly and
people are back into their bad habits within weeks or days.

\subsection{我的未来不是梦}

When students graduate from college, many of them
do not know how they want to spend their working lives,
and they sometimes move from job to job until they find
something that suits them, and, of equal importance,
to which they are suited ( 难句解析).

Others never find a job in which they are really happy.
They remain all their lives, square pegs in round holes.
When we choose our careers, we need to ask ourselves
two questions. First, what do we think we would like to be?
Second, what kind of people are we?

The idea, for example, of being a painter or a musician
may seem very attractive; but unless we have great talent
and are willing to work very hard, we are certain to fail in
these occupations, and failure will lead to unhappiness
in life. So, it is important to assess our suitability for a
certain career in a job search.


\subsection{你是老几？}
Were you the first or the last child in your family? Or were
you a middle or an only child? Some people think it matters
where you were born in your family. But there are different
ideas about what birth order means.

Some people say that oldest children are smart
and strong-willed. They are very likely to be successful.
The reason for this is simple. Parents have a lot of time for
their first child; they give him or her a lot of attention. So
this child is very likely to do well. An only child will
succeed for the same reason. What happens to the other
children in the family?

Middle children don't get so much attention, so they
don't feel that important. If a family has many children, the
middle one sometimes gets lost in the crowd. The youngest
child, though, often gets special treatment. He or she is the
baby. Often this child grows up to be funny and charming.

Do you believe this idea of birth order too? A recent
study saw things quite differently. The study found that first
children believed in family rules. They didn't take many
chances in their lives. They usually followed orders.

Rules didn't mean as much\sn{didn't mean as much =
	mean less。所以这句话的意思
	是：Rules mean less to later
	children. ( 后出生的孩子更不把
	规则当回事)。2. go out 的释义
	之一是 break ( 打破)，结合上
	下文此处可理解为“打破常规} to later children in the
family. They went out and followed their own ideas. They took chances and they often did better in life.
\subsection{广告}
Advertising has already become a very specialized activity
in modern times. In today's business world, supply is
usually greater than demand.

There is great competition between manufacturers of the
same kind of product because they want to persuade
customers to buy their particular brand. They always
have to remind their customers of the name and qualities
of their products by advertising.

The manufacturer advertises in newspapers and on
the radio. He sometimes employs salesgirls to distribute
samples of his product. He sometimes advertises on the
Internet as well.

In addition, he always has advertisements put into television
programs that will accept them. Manufacturers often
spend huge sums of money on advertisements.

We buy a particular product because we think that is the
best. We usually think so because the advertisements say
so. People often don't ask themselves if the advertisements
are telling the truth when they buy advertised products
from shops.

\subsection{有人可以一辈子不睡觉}
The thought of having no sleep for 24 hours or more isn't
a pleasant one for most people. The amount of sleep that
each person needs varies.

In general, each of us needs about 8 hours of sleep each
day to keep us healthy and happy. Some people, however,
can get by with just a few hours of sleep at night.

It doesn't matter when or how much a person sleeps.
But everyone needs some rest to stay alive. Few doctors
would have thought that there might be an exception to this.

Sleep is, after all, a very basic need. But a man named Al
Herpin turned out to be a real exception, for supposedly,
he never slept!

Al Herpin\sn{奥尔· 赫平} was 90 years old when doctors
came to his home in New Jersey. They hoped to challenge
the claim that he never slept.

But they were surprised. Though they watched him every
hour of the day, they never saw Herpin sleeping. He did
not even own a bed. He never needed one.

The closest that Herpin came to resting was to sit in a
rocking chair and read a half dozen newspapers. His
doctors were puzzled by the strange case of permanent
sleeplessness.

Herpin offered the only clue to his condition. He remembered
some talk about his mother having been injured
several days before he had been born.
Herpin died at the age of 94, never, it seems, having slept
at all.
\subsection{压力其实是六个单词}
Life is very stressful nowadays, so it is useful for us to talk
about how to cope with stress. If you want to reduce some
stress, you can reduce this by the word S-T-R-E-S-S. That's
stress. Let's begin with the “S”. “S” is that you can
have the “scheduling”. For example, you don't have to
schedule too many things in your day and if you feel you
are too busy, you can cut out an activity or two.

And “T” is “treat your body well”, because experts say
that exercise can reduce stress and also if you eat healthy
food, then your brain and your body get the nourishment
they need. The next letter is “R”. “R” means “relax”. You
can do an activity you enjoy or that relaxes you. Maybe you 
can read a book or learn a new hobby and even spend time 
with your pet and that could make a difference.

And the next letter is “E”—“E” is about expectations. This
means “be realistic about yourself and others”. So
you can just do your best and don't try to be perfect and
don't expect others to be, too. That will release and reduce
a lot of stress for you and the people around you.


And the next letter is “S” again, which means
“smile”. If you smile and have confidence, you'll think in a
more positive way and then you'll feel more comfortable
when you are coping with the stress.

\subsection{快速阅读有学问}
Most American college students need to be efficient readers.
This is necessary because full-time students probably
have to read several hundred pages every week. They
don't have time to read a chapter three or four times.
They need to extract as much information as possible from
the first or second reading.

An extraordinarily important study skill is knowing how to
mark a book. Students mark the main ideas and important
details with a pen or pencil, yellow or blue or orange.
Some students mark new vocabulary in a different color.
Most students write questions or short notes in the margins.

Marking a book is a useful skill, but it's important to do it
right. First, read a chapter with one pen in your hand and
others next to you on the desk. Second, read a whole
paragraph before you mark anything. Don't mark too
much. Usually you will mark about 10\% of a passage.
Third, decide on your own system for marking.

For example, maybe you will mark main ideas in yellow,
important details in blue and new words in orange. Maybe
you will put question marks in the margin when you don't
understand something.

When your chapter is a rainbow of markings, you don't
have to read all of it again before an exam. Instead,
you just need to review your marks and you can save a lot
of time.
\subsection{戴眼镜会让眼睛变形么？}
There are many commonly held beliefs about eye
glasses and eyesight that are not proven facts. For instance,
some people believe that wearing glasses too
soon weakens the eyes. But there is no evidence to show
that the structure of eyes is changed by wearing glasses at
a young age.

Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful.
Studies show that for adults there is no danger, but
children can develop loss of vision if they have glasses inappropriate
for their eyes.

We have all heard some of the common myths about how
eyesight gets bad. Most people believe that reading in
dim light causes poor eyesight, but that is untrue. Too little
light makes the eyes work harder, so they do get tired and
strained.

Eyestrain also results from reading a lot, reading in bed,
and watching too much television. However, although
eyestrain may cause some pain or headaches, it does not
permanently damage eyesight.

Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced, or
transferred from one person to another. There are close
to one million nerve fibres that connect the eyeball to the
brain, as of yet it is impossible to attach them all in a new
person.

Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced. But if
we keep clearing up the myths and learning more about
the eyes, someday a full transplant may be possible.

The train now standing at Platform 9 is the 10:48 train
calling at all stations to Nanjing. Please note, the train on
Platform 9 is not the 10:52 train to Jinan. It's the 10:48 train,
calling at all stations to Nanjing.

The 10:52 to Jinan will now leave from Platform 7. Train
announcement, the 11:20 train to Zhengzhou from Platform

the 11:28 train to Hangzhou from Platform 15 has been
cancelled.

The 11:32 train to Tianjin is now standing at Platform 13.
Please note, there will be no restaurant car on this train. I
repeat. There will be no restaurant car on the 11:32 to Tianjin
now standing at Platform 13.

\subsection{你也能做天气预报}
To find out what the weather is going to be, most people
go straight to the radio, television, or newspaper to get an
expert weather forecast. But if you know what to look
for, you can use your own senses to make weather predictions.
There are many signs that can help you.

For example, in fair weather the air pressure is generally
high, the air is still and often full of dust, and far away objects
may look vague. But when the storm is brewing,
the pressure drops, and you are often able to see things
more clearly. Sailors took note of this long ago, and
came up with the saying, “The farther the sight, the nearer
the rain.”

Your sense of smell can also help you detect the weather
changes. Just before it rains, odors become stronger, this is
because odors are repressed in a fair high-pressure center.
When a bad weather low moves in, air pressure lessens
and odors are released.

You can also hear an approaching storm. Sounds bounce
off heavy storm clouds and return to earth with increased
force. An old saying describes it this way, “Sound
traveling far and wide, a stormy day will betide”.

And don't laugh at your grandmother if she says she can
feel a storm coming. It is commonly known that many
people feel pains in their bones or joints while the humidity
rises, the pressure drops, and bad weather is on the way.
